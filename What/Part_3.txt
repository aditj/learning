Part 3: Fail and Take A Route
Before I explain what each of the options means thereâ€™s the 4th option as well: Doing Nothing, which I comment later on. Okay once the system is done evaluating and has failed and has decided to take another chance, it can do one or a combination of the following:
1. Try another time:
	a. With the same solution/method
	b. Try a new/modified solution
2. Initialize better or changing the interpretation of the problem itself, this often leads to changing the expectation associated with the problem
3. Changing/Giving up on the problem completely
